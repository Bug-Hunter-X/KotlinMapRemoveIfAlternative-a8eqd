This example demonstrates an uncommon error in Kotlin related to the `removeIf` function.  The `removeIf` function works correctly with `MutableList` and `MutableSet`, but it's not supported for `MutableMap`. Attempting to use it with a map will result in a compilation error.  The solution provides an alternative approach to remove elements from a map based on a condition.
